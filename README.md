## Some Initial Thoughts
C++ is a flexible, challenging, mid-level language that has so many applications — in operating systems, games, web browsers (think Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome), and applications (like Adobe Photoshop, Microsoft Office, Visual Studio). 

I find that really cool, and will be logging things I try out on this repository.
The idea is to start from the absolute basics (print statements, if-else, user input, loops) and work my way to more complex programs.

Let's go! 🚀
